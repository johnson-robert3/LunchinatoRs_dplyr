# LunchinatoRs_dplyr

This repository contains the resources used to lead the LunchinatoRs workshop on the basics of the 'dplyr' package (part of the Tidyverse).

Iowa State University. 11 October 2019.


There are some helpful resources included for learning the basic functions of the 'dplyr' package, other useful functions contained in the package, as well as more advanced functionality provided by dplyr. 

Practice data sets and scripts are also provided for exploring dplyr's functions and visualizing what the core functions are doing with your data.
